# Alternating Tree Automata for Restricted First Order Logic.

I referred to

- the paper [*Learning Formulas in Finite Variable Logics*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3498671) for the main idea of the project.
- the repo [`FOLParser`](https://github.com/lfm0006/FOLParser/) for the g4 file of First Order Logic.
- the paper [*Coalgebraic Determinization of Alternating Automata*](http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02546) for the determinization algorithm of DFA.
- the paper [*Trace semantics via determinization*](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022000014001676) for the understanding of concepts of coalgebra and determinization.
- the Notes [$\mathcal{PP}$ *is not monad?!*](https://joshuamoerman.nl/notes/17pp-is-not-a-monad.pdf) for the understanding of attempt of explaining $\mathcal{PP}$ as a monad.

A quick start:

```bash
make all
make compile
make test   # run tests
make run    # run the project
```
