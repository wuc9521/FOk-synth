# Exact Learning: Formulas with Finite Variables.

A possible implementaion of [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3498671), using ANTLR4.

I referred to [this repo](https://github.com/lfm0006/FOLParser/) for the g4 file of First Order Logic.

A quick start:

```bash
make all
make compile
make run
```
